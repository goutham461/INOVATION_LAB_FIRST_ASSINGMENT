How do you destructure an object with nested properties?
By unpacking values directly from inside another object using curly braces with the property path.

When should you use bracket notation over dot notation?
When the property name is stored in a variable or has spaces/special characters.

What methods can you use to iterate through object properties?
for...in, Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries().

Explain the rest parameters vs the spread operator with examples.
Rest gathers multiple values into one variable; spread expands values out of an array or object.

How does call() differ from apply()?
call() passes arguments individually, while apply() passes them as an array.

What does bind() do to a function?
It creates a new function with a fixed this value that cannot be changed when called.
